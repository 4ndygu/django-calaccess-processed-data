A Django app to transform and refine campaign finance data from the California Secretary of Stateâ€™s `CAL-ACCESS <http://www.sos.ca.gov/prd/cal-access/>`__ database.

Intended as a second layer atop `django-calaccess-raw-data <https://github.com california-civic-data-coalition/django-calaccess-raw-data>`_ that transforms the source data and loads it into simplified models that serve as a platform for analysis.

.. warning::

    This is a work in progress. Its analysis should be considered as provisional until it is further tested and debugged.
